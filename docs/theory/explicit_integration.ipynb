    "    When using implicit integration techniques like those found in the Radau and GaussLobatto transcriptions, an evaluation of the model computes the collocation defects.\n",
    "    It does not propagate a physically valid trajectory unless the proposed trajectory is itself physically valid.\n",
    "    The use of `solve_segments=True` with the pseudospectral methods uses OpenMDAO's nonlinear solvers to converge the trajectory rather than posing them as constraints to be resolved by the optimizer, but in this case the behavior is still implicit.\n",

    "    Sometimes underlying data can be noisy.\n",
    "    For instance, a thrust trace for a rocket engine being simulated is one example - it can contain hundreds of data points over the course of a few seconds.\n",
    "    In these situations, it's best to smooth this data to get a model that behaves better for gradient based optimization while providing the same performance, but sometimes a user might just want Dymos to power through this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit integration in Dymos is performed under the `ExplicitShooting` transcription.\n",
    "This transcription propagates the trajectory from some initial state for some given time duration, subject to the provided parameters and controls, using explicit Runge-Kutta methods.\n",

    "In Dymos, explicit integration for single shooting is handled by `RKIntegrationComp`.\n",
    "It propagates the states whose rates are provided by the ODE ($\\dot{\\bar{x}}$), in addition to accumulating the derivatives across the integration ($\\left[ \\frac{d\\bar{x}_q}{d\\bar{Z}} \\right]$, $\\left[ \\frac{dt_q}{d\\bar{Z}} \\right]$).\n",

    "Method `eval_f` is used to evaluate the ODE at a given point.\n",
    "A subproblem is instantiated with its own copy of the ODE (with `num_nodes=1`)\n",
    "This subproblem is then evaluated via `run_model` at the given data point, and the state rates and algebraic outputs extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation of the derivatives is handled by `eval_f_derivs` and `eval_f_derivs_vectorized`.\n",
    "The latter is used when evaluating the derivatives at the intermediate stages.\n",
    "While the ($X_i$) at each stage depends upon the rates computed in the previous stage ($k_{qi}$), we can postpone the evaluation of the derivatives until the states and times are known at each stage.\n",
    "This significantly improves performance due to the overhead of the `compute_totals` method in the underlying subproblem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the `RKIntegrationComp` carries two subproblem instances: `_subprob_eval` and `_subprob_derivs`, where the former is allocated with one node and the latter with a number of nodes corresponding to the number of stages in the Runge-Kutta method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `compute_partials` method of `RKIntegrationComp` tests to verify that the current design point was previously evaluated by `compute`.\n",
    "Assuming it was, the numerical integration does not need to be done again, and it simply extracts the relevant accumulated derivatives and returns them.\n",
    "This speeds up the cost of `compute_partials` by orders of magnitude, at the expense of making the `compute` method roughly twice as expensive, due to the added cost of accumulating the derivatives during every propagation, whether they will be wanted or not."
